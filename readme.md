# Face Recognition Project

## Overview

This open-source project is dedicated to developing a robust face recognition system. Leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the system can accurately detect and recognize faces in images.

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect faces within images.
- **Face Embeddings:** Extracts facial features and generates embeddings for each face using a pre-trained deep neural network.
- **Recognition:** Matches facial embeddings to a database of known individuals, enabling face recognition.
- **Webcam Integration:** Real-time face recognition through webcam feeds, allowing for seamless integration into applications and systems.
